# Malware
This is a collection of malware that I discover with my IDS and find interesting.

I do this by having Security Onion sniff all the traffic on a public IP address of mine 
and I analyze anything interesting that adversaries are spraying accross IP blocks

So far Mozi.m is a popular one out of China and the ARM executable is in the Mozi directory
