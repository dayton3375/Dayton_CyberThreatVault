# Log4Shell Exploitation
This directory contains my findings on the Log4Shell exploits that hit my router's firewall.

MaliciousRequests.txt shows that most of the attacks are in the HTTP Authentication Header, attempting to fail a logon attempt to get the maliciuos jdni string logged.

There are packet captures of each of these attacks and also there are the malware payloads that I downloaded from two adversaries command and control servers.
